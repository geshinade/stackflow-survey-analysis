# stackoverflow-survey-analysis
This is an Exploratory Data Analysis of Stackoverflow developer survey. The survey is conducted annually by StackOverflow. You can find the data and results [here](https://insights.stacoverflow.com/survey).
I drew heavily from FreeCodeCamp course: Data Analysis with Python Course - Numpy, Pandas, Data Visualization and Corey Schafer's [Python Pandas tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyhVh-qRZPA&list=PL-osiE80TeTsWmV9i9c58mdDCSskIFdDS)
